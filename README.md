## About

Inspired by Filip Hracek's [Year Progress](https://twitter.com/year_progress), I decided to create a customizable web app with Flutter that shows the progress of the workday, day, week, month and year.

Feel free to [set it as your browser home page](https://kylekun.com/time_progress/) and get anxious everyday with me seeing how fast time flies xD.

## Features

- Add a custom background image
- Show precise or rounded percentages
- Swap the order of the progress bars
- Show or hide the current date
- Choose the colors from the various Material 3 themes
- Your preferences are saved automatically
- No analytics or tracking, as it's hosted inside my [open source blog](https://github.com/KyleKun/blog/)
